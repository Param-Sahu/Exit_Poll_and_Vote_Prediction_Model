# Election Exit Poll and Voter Prediction Model 
**Problem Statement :** You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                                      | Interpretation                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`vote`**                    | The political party the voter supports. Values: `"Labour"` or `"Conservative"`                                   | This is your **target variable** ‚Äî what you're trying to predict using all other features.                             |
| **`age`**                     | Age of the voter in years.                                                                                       | A numeric feature. Older or younger voters may prefer different parties.                                               |
| **`economic.cond.national`**  | Rating of the **country‚Äôs economic condition** (1‚Äì5 scale).                                                      | Subjective opinion: **1 = very bad**, **5 = very good**. May influence party preference based on national performance. |
| **`economic.cond.household`** | Rating of **personal/household financial situation** (1‚Äì5 scale).                                                | Also subjective: how well-off the respondent feels economically. Important for voter behavior.                         |
| **`Blair`**                   | How the respondent rates **Tony Blair**, leader of the Labour Party at the time (1‚Äì5 scale).                     | **1 = dislike very much**, **5 = like very much**. A high score suggests voter favors Labour.                          |
| **`Hague`**                   | Rating of **William Hague**, leader of the Conservative Party (1‚Äì5 scale).                                       | Similarly, **higher scores** suggest **preference for the Conservatives**.                                             |
| **`Europe`**                  | 11-point scale on attitude toward **European integration**. Higher = **more Eurosceptic** (less support for EU). | Political alignment with EU-related issues. Can influence support for parties based on EU stance.                      |
| **`political.knowledge`**     | How well the respondent understands each party‚Äôs EU position (0‚Äì3 scale).                                        | **0 = no knowledge**, **3 = high knowledge**. May correlate with how confidently a person votes.                       |
| **`gender`**                  | Gender of the voter: `"male"` or `"female"`.                                                                     | Used to analyze demographic influence on vote preference.                                                              |


üí° Example Interpretation:
A person who:

Rates Blair = 5, Hague = 1

Thinks national economy = 4, household = 4

Has low Euroscepticism (Europe = 2)
... is likely to vote Labour, based on ideology and leadership preference.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
See `Election_EDA_Report.html` for Automated EDA Report and EDA revealed the following insights:

‚úÖ **Labour Party :**

 - Both females and males voted predominantly for Labour.

 - *Females cast more votes than males for Labour*.

 - Labour shows stronger appeal across all genders, particularly female voters.

‚úÖ **Conservative Party :**

 - Overall, fewer votes were cast for Conservatives compared to Labour.

 - *Females again outvoted males for Conservatives, though the gap is smaller than in Labour.*

‚úÖ **Overall Gender Voting Trend :**

 - *Female voters are more active than male voters* in this dataset (consistent with the previous bar chart: 808 females vs. 709 males).

 - Female votes outnumber male votes across both political parties.

 - Labour maintains broader gender support, while Conservative support is more limited and shows a lower male participation.

#### üìä  Age Group-Based Voting Trends :

**Younger Age Groups (18‚Äì30 and 31‚Äì45) :**

 - Show strong support for Labour, suggesting that younger voters lean more progressive or are more influenced by Labour‚Äôs messaging.

 - Labour gains a significant portion of its votes from these age groups.

**Middle Age Group (46‚Äì60) :**

 - Slightly more balanced between the two parties but still shows Labour in the lead.

 - This group might reflect working-class concerns that resonate more with Labour policies.

**Older Age Group (61+) :**

 - Conservative support increases slightly here, but Labour still maintains a lead.

 - This could suggest some generational alignment with traditional conservative values but not enough to surpass Labour.

#### üéØ Conclusion :
The Labour Party dominates across both gender and age groups, making it the most popular party in this dataset and **Clear Win of Labour Party**.

 - **Female voters are the most engaged, casting more votes than males in both parties.**

 - **Labour‚Äôs success is especially strong among young voters**, while **Conservatives perform relatively better among older demographics**, but not enough to close the gap.

These trends could reflect differences in political priorities, outreach strategies, or social engagement patterns across demographics.

Among all models, Boosting delivered the highest test accuracy (84.9%), indicating that it is the best performing model for this dataset. 

 ### Inference
  -	Adaptive Boosting outperformed all other models in terms of test accuracy (84.9%), making it the best overall. It achieved a good balance of precision and recall.
  -	Naive Bayes surprised with a strong test performance despite a lower training score ‚Äî indicating excellent generalization.
  -	LDA and Logistic Regression were also strong contenders with consistent and high accuracy, showing they are still competitive for linear separability.
  -	kNN had the highest training accuracy, suggesting it might be overfitting slightly ‚Äî as its test accuracy dropped a bit.
  -	Random Forest and Bagging had solid but slightly lower performance, possibly due to parameter defaults or redundancy in tree-based ensembles for this dataset.
### Conclusion
  -	Best Performing Model: Boosting ‚Äî **Adaptive Boosting** ‚Äî due to its superior accuracy and f1-score.
  -	**Caution :** Models like kNN and Random Forest can overfit if hyperparameters aren‚Äôt tuned.
  -	Recommended Final Model: Boosting, with potential tuning for learning_rate and n_estimators=1000.

## Streamlit Deployment
A user-friendly Streamlit web application was created to allow users to input voter features and get real-time predictions using the trained AdaBoost model `voter_model.pkl`.
